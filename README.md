What's New
---------------------

__20th April 2019__

1.9.0 has been released as another in-between version of the 1.x API and 2.0 API. It is recommended upgrading to 1.9.0 to ease the transition to 2.0 later on. As previous stated, 1.9.x will only receive bug fixes and optimisations going forward. Once 2.0 is released, 1.9.x will be 100% community-driven.
